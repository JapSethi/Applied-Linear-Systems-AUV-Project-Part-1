# Applied-Linear-Systems-AUV-Project-Part-1

**To design a state-feedback control system that can control the H-AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) depth and longitudinal position** 

#### Objectives Achieved: 

- Modeled MIMO dynamic systems using state-space techniques.
- Analytically and numerically solved for the dynamic response of any linear dynamic system and relate the response to the state-space system description.
- Analyzed the open-loop and closed-loop stability of any state-space representation.
- Designed linear state-feedback controllers using pole placement techniques.
